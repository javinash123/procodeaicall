I’m ready to replace a chunk of our human effort with a voice-driven AI that can handle product-demonstration sales calls from start to finish. The goal is simple: when a new lead lands in our dialer, the agent should call, present the key demo points conversationally, answer common questions, and either book a meeting with a human closer or close the sale outright—without sounding robotic.
 
What I expect you to deliver:
 
• A production-ready, cloud-deployable voice agent that can dial out, greet the prospect, walk through a scripted yet dynamic product demonstration, handle objections, and log the outcome.
• Real-time transcription, intent detection, and simple fallback rules so a human can take over if confidence drops.
• A quick configuration panel where my customers team can tweak the pitch, FAQs, and qualifying criteria.
 
Because this is time-sensitive, I’d like to see a working proof-of-concept within the first few days and a fully tested agent ready to roll out ASAP. If you have prior examples of voice AI for sales, even better—share a link or demo recording and let’s get moving.

I wanted to integrate messages as well, sending bulk SMS messages
 
The key points are below - 
1. SaaS based requirement 
2. AI voice calling
3. Bulk sms
4. Basic CRM for your clients 
5. Open AI for human like voice calling 
6. Subscription model
7. Admin panel for you to manage the data
 
I need a darker and lighter theme, White and Orange and black and orange.

Design me a website with all the basic pages like home, products, pricing, about, contact, register, login, after login a basic crm for customers and an admin panel for me as the product owner. I think the basic crm for customers can be on same design as the admin panel.

Below is the proposal that i had submitted to the client for design and development - 

1. Executive Summary / Objective
This document outlines the complete technical, functional, and business proposal for
developing an AI-powered outbound sales demonstration system. The solution automates
sales demo calls using OpenAI Realtime API, Twilio Telephony, and AWS cloud
infrastructure. It also includes a CRM module, admin dashboard, appointment booking, call
summaries, and a newly-added Bulk SMS Notification Module.
2. Client Pain Points
- High manual effort required for outbound demo calls.
- Inconsistent pitch delivery among sales representatives.
- Delayed response time for new leads.
- No centralized system for tracking call outcomes and follow-ups.
- Multilingual lead communication challenges.
- No automated SMS follow-up system (now included as a new feature).
3. Proposed Solution
We propose a cloud-deployed AI Voice Agent capable of performing human-like outbound
calling, providing product demonstrations, handling FAQs, and booking appointments. The
system will include multilingual support and handle objection scenarios using a
configurable script. It also features an internal CRM, admin dashboard, and a Bulk SMS
module for follow-ups or reminders.
4. Key Features & Modules
- AI Voice Agent with natural conversational ability
- Outbound calling (manual trigger) via Twilio
- Realtime transcription and intent handling through OpenAI Realtime API
- Multilingual voice support
- FAQ and objection handling engine
- Appointment booking
- Call summaries logged into a CRM
- Admin dashboard for script/config editing
- Bulk SMS module using Twilio SMS API
- AWS cloud deployment
5. Detailed Functional Requirements
5.1 Outbound Calling:
- Manual trigger for calls

Booking → Summary → CRM Entry → SMS Follow-up
7. System Architecture
Admin Panel → Backend API → Twilio Voice & SMS → OpenAI Realtime → CRM DB → AWS
Infrastructure
8. Technical Stack
Backend: Node.js
Frontend: React.js
AI: OpenAI Realtime API
Telephony: Twilio Voice + Twilio SMS
Database: AWS RDS
Storage: AWS S3
Deployment: AWS EC2
